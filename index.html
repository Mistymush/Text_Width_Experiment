            <p>The following web-page contains two visualisations of a data set collected <br/>
            from 140 playthroughs of the puzzle game Eukaryote, designed by an MQP team at WPI.</p>
            
            <p>Players raced to complete 8 puzzles within a fifteen minute time limit.<br/>
            Unknowingly, players were assigned one of two tutorial level progressions shown above.</p>
            
            <p>Roughly half of players received the one level depicted on the right.<br/>
                Those who received the second longer tutorial, first played the two easy levels depicted<br/>
                on the left, and then proceeded to the same level as the other players depicted on the right.</p>
            
            <p>During the experiment, player statistics of performance on each level were recorded alongside <br/>
            a video recording of each player's face to used for AI analysis.</p>
            
            <p>From this data the team has generated two hypotheses  about puzzle gameplay:</p>
            
             <div id="title_line"> 1: The long level progression provides a smoother learning experience.
            </div>
             <div id="title_line"> 2: During gameplay, player's emotions cycle from being frustrated for longer periods<br/>
                 to being joyful for a short period when the completing  a level.
            </div>
            
            <p>The following Vis attempts to answer the first question: <br/>
            Is one level progression easier to learn than another?</p>

            <p>In each scatter plot blue represents players who received the longer tutorial, these players<br/>
                started the game on level -2. <br/>
                Players who received the longer tutorial can be viewed as orange starting at level 0.<br/>
                On this vis it is possible to select one of two trend line types with the dropdown below.</p>
            <div id="title_line"> Vis 1.
